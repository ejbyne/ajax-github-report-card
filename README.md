# Ajax GitHub Report Card

Summary

This was an introduction to using Ajax and APIs in Week 6 at Makers Academy. 

We created a single-page GitHub report card application which enables the user to search for a username. The application then uses an Ajax request to retrieve the user's data from the GitHub API, and then display that data on the screen.

## Technologies used

- Ajax
- GitHub API
- JQuery
- Mustache.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Sinatra
